# Gaia Souce Image Creation [GSIC]
- This project ustilizes data from the [Gaia Source](http://cdn.gea.esac.esa.int/Gaia/gedr3/gaia_source/) catalog to generate visual representation of our Galaxy. By parsing stellar parameter such as position (RA, Dec), parallax and blue and red parameters (bp_rp), the system plots start according to their spatial distribution, brightness and color.
