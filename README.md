# GAIA EDR3 (Early Data Release 3) - Image Render

### Topic:
- Create an image with the starts brithness transleted to black and white scale. Each pixel shall just have the ilumination value of the current star. No position necessary. Note that the size of the image can be the sqrt of the number of stars to be parsed, since its just a test and the image can be a 1:1 res. This is just a color testing and calibration, after it we can bring colors and also brigthness. This code should also be flexible. We will need to use it latter.

- The next important step is to alocate the starss into their position. I want a mercator projection and also a up view of the galaxy.
